# GAN
Generative Adversarial Network hands on 

## 01_gan_mnist_mode_collapse
Goal : Generate fake images which looks very similar to real images with out seeing them
* In this example a simple GAN model is used to generate real like fake images using MNIST dataset
* Simple GAN can lead to mode collapse where generator tries to generate very similar (or same) images for any input noise

## 02_gan_mnist_dcgan
Goal : Generate fake images which looks very similar to real images with out seeing them
* In this example a Deep Convolutional GAN is used to avoid mode collapse commonly happens in simple GANs
* MNIST dataset is taken for real images
